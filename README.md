# Dcentra-Funding

Dcentra-Funding is a decentralized app for personal fundraising, it is (greatly) inspired by Gofundme.com. The app was built with React, Next and Chakra-UI. <br />
The transactions are handled by a Solidity Smart Contract. Truffle and Web3 were used to interact from the frontend with the smart contract. <br />
This project was made to learn by myself how to build a dapp on Ethereum Blockchain (which is absolutely awesome). The smart contract is deployed on Ropsten Test Network and is not meant to ever be on Main Network.

## Technologies used

- React
- Next
- Chakra-UI
- Emotion
- ETH Blockchain (Solidity / Truffle / Ganache / Web3)
- Tested on Ropsten Test Network
